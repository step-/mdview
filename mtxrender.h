/* Render Markdown into any of the formats supported by MTX.

 * Callback process_output() gets called with chunks of HTML output.
 * (Typical implementation may just output the bytes to a file or append to

 * Param userdata is just propagated back to process_output() callback.
 * Param parser_flags are flags from md4c.h propagated to md_parse().
 * Param render_flags is bitmask of MD_HTML_FLAG_xxxx.
